This page contains a collection of papers that set milestones in using a Bayesian approach in quantitative genetics. 

* RÃ¸nningen K. (1971). [Some Properties of the Selection Index derived by "Henderson's Mixed Model Method"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1971.tb01365.x/abstract). J Anim Breed Genet. 129:474-487. 
 Pehaps this is the first attempt to investigate the connection between BLUP/Selection Index and Bayesian Inference.
